            int y = 6;
            //+ As we learned in the previous section, ints are Integers: numbers without decimals.
            //& Ask students which variable is greater. The correct answer is (y), because 6 > 5.

            //+ Java can actually compare numbers for us. We use the following operators:
            //+ > (greater than), < (less than), == (equal to), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to), and != (not equal to).
            //+ Instead of asking you all which integer is greater, I can ask Java by printing a comparison of two numbers

        /*COMPARISONS: Greater Than (or equal to) and Less Than (or equal to)*/

            //! 
            //@ The output of the statement is true because y is greater than x. 
            //& What would happen if we reversed the comparison sign from greater than to less than?

            System.out.println(y < x);
            //!
            //@ The output of the statement is false because y is not less than x.

            System.out.println(y >= x);
            //!
            //@ The output of this statement is true because y is greater than or equal to x. 
            //& What would happen if we added 1 to x, x became 6, and we ran this code again?

            x++;
            System.out.println(y >= x);
            //!
            //@ The output of this statement is still true because y is greater than or equal to x. In this case it is equal to x.
            //& Have students experiment with the different operators
        
        /*BOOLEAN LOGIC, NOT, AND, & OR*/
            
            int v = 8;
            //+ What if we want to evaluate multiple conditions at the same time. Such as: y >= x AND y >= v. How would we do this?
            //+ In Java we do this using special operators. AND is && and OR is ||.
            //+ Thus, the code for the example y >= x AND y >= v would look like this:   
            
            System.out.println(y >= x && y >= v);
            //& Remember that y = 6 and x = 6.
            //& Before running, ask students what this will evaluate to. (The answer should be false because although y >= x, y is not >= v) 
            //!

            System.out.println(y >= x || y >= v);
            //& Before running, ask students what this will evaluate to. (The answer should be true because y >= x)
            //!
            //+ If we change this operator to || (OR), only one of the conditions has to be true. So, since y >= x is true, this returns true.


            //+ In Java, we can also put an exclamation point before a condition to take the opposite of the result, think of the ! as the word NOT. 
            //+ For example, 4 > 3 returns true, but if we type !(4 > 3), we get NOT(true) â€” which is false.

            System.out.println(!(y >= x));
            //!
            //+ This prints false because y is greater than or equal to x, so (y>=x) evaluates to true. Then, the ! operator takes the opposite of true, which is false.


        /*BOOLEANS*/
        
            //+ When a value can either be true or false, we call that value a boolean. To remember this, think BOO-lean, the BOO rhymes with TWO, and booleans only have two possible return values: true or false
            boolean z = true;
            boolean q = false;
            //+ We can declare boolean variables just like we declare integer, String, or any other type of variables.

            System.out.println(z);
            System.out.println(q);
            //!
            //+ As you can see, boolean z prints true and boolean q prints false.

        /*COMPARISONS: Equals and Not Equals*/
            //+ As you might have seen earlier, the operator for equal to is TWO equal signs, not ONE. This is because one equal sign is reserved for declaring variables.
            System.out.println(x == y);
            //!
            //@ The output of this statement is true because y is 6, x is 6, and 6 equals 6. Remember that we wrote x++; earlier to increment x by 1.
            System.out.println(z == q);
            //!
            //@ The output of this statement is false because boolean z is true, boolean q is false, and true doesn't equal false, making our statement false.
            //+ As you might have seen earlier, the operator for not equal to is an exclamation point combined with an equal sign (!=).
            
            System.out.println(z != q);
            //!
            //@ This statement is true because boolean z is true, boolean q is false, and true doesn't equal false, making our statement true.
            
        /*USER INPUT*/
            //+ When we have been running code earlier, the output has been displayed in a Terminal window. Did you know you can also provide INPUT to the terminal window?
            //+ Giving the computer information during the runtime of a program is called user input, and this next section will show you how user input works in Java.
            //+ At the top of the program, we need to add "import java.util.Scanner;" to import the Java utility Scanner class.
            //+ Classes are something we will discuss later but you can think of the Scanner class as another person's code that we borrowed.

            Scanner myScanner = new Scanner(System.in);
            //! This is how we create a Scanner called myScanner.
            //+ myScanner will "scan" (or take in) for whatever the user types into the terminal.

            System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
            //!
            //@ Now that we have created a scanner, we'll print "Enter your name:" in the output window to direct the user to give us their name.
            //& Enter your name in the terminal.

            String name = myScanner.nextLine();
            //@ We'll store the user's name in a String variable. We set name equal to the next line of our open scanner.

            System.out.println("Hi, " + name);
            //!
            //@ We'll greet the user by using string concatenation, combining the phrase "Hi, " with the name variable.
            //& The students can be creative with both the message they display and the input they take.

        /*USER INPUT CONT., TYPECASTING, IF / ELSE STATEMENTS*/
            //+ In this next section we'll create a calculator that calculates values based on user input.
            //+ There's one challenge: user input is in the form of a String, and calculators work with Integers and Doubles.
            //+ We can use typecasting to convert a String to an Integer or Double.
            
            String numberInputInteger = "37";
            String numberInputDouble = "49.4";
            //@ Here we have two Strings that need to be converted to numbers, the first to an int and the second to a double.

            int integerInput = Integer.parseInt(numberInputInteger);
            Double doubleInput = Double.parseDouble(numberInputDouble);

            //!
            //@ The following methods: Integer.parseInt() and Double.parseDouble() convert Strings to integers and doubles, respectively.
            //@ integerInput contains the int version of "37" and doubleInput contains the double version of "49.4"

            //@ We will have the user enter a whole number 
            //@ The input is origanally a string, so we wrap it in Integer.parseInt to convert it to an integer

            Double value2 = Double.parseDouble(Calculator.nextLine());
            //@ We will have the user enter a Double and store it as value2

            //+ Remember there are four possible operators: + (additon), - (substraction), * (multiplication), and / (division).
            //& Ask the students and have them really think about this:
            //& How do we write code to account for each operator?


            //+ The answer is an if statement.
            //+ We use if statements in Java to perform an operation only IF a condition is satisfied. The condition must be true or false.
            //+ Things to note: 
            //+ If statements can be but don't have to be followed by else if statements, and a final else statement at the end.
            //+ If, else if, and else chains of logic are always evaluated from top to bottom.
            //+ You don't always need else if statement(s). You are allowed to write an if statement followed by an else statement.
